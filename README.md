This report focuses on the vital health problem of Obesity in the United States which became prevalent in western countries in the 1980s. By definition, Obesity is a case where the Body Mass Index is equal or above 30 due to abnormal or excessive fat accumulation. The progression of Obesity among adults of age 20 - 74 has risen over the years from 15% (1976 - 1980) to 23.3% (1988 - 1994) to 30.9% (in 1999 - 2000).
Here are some causes of this obesity pandemic:
Dietary Fat
Sugar and Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Hike of farm bills and food prices
The rate of increase in obesity population has continued in an upward movement from 2000 - 2016. My project follows an examination into this from the year 2015 - 2021.
An investigation into the obesity population in Georgia has been conducted which has birthed this report regarding the trend in the specified year(s). A cross examination of neighboring states has also been carried out to include Obesity percentages in Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida in comparison to Georgia, to understand how these border states are performing.
